# MLB Season Splits Scraper - Desktop App Packaging Project Resume

I have a fully working MLB Season Splits scraper built with Node.js + Express + Puppeteer that works perfectly on localhost. I want to package it as a desktop app that friends can download and use without technical setup.

## CURRENT WORKING STATE:
- **Server:** Node.js Express server with Puppeteer web scraping
- **Frontend:** Clean HTML interface with blue start button → progress tracking → green CSV download
- **Port:** Currently runs on localhost:3001 (was 3000, changed during troubleshooting)
- **Files:** server.js, package.json, public/index.html, node_modules/
- **Status:** Works perfectly when run with `node server.js`

## WHAT WE TRIED (All Failed):
1. **Electron packaging** - Development works (`npm run electron-dev`) but packaged .app files show blank white screens
2. **Various main.js approaches** - spawn, fork, different Node.js paths - all fail in packaged environment
3. **PKG standalone executable** - Execution errors, can't find dependencies
4. **Manual .app bundle creation** - Browser opens but can't connect to server

## KEY TECHNICAL FINDINGS:
- Electron development mode works fine
- Packaging always fails - blank screens or spawn errors like "Error: spawn ENOENT", "spawn ENOTDIR"
- Issue seems to be server process not starting correctly in packaged environment
- Files are being included in package correctly (verified by extracting app.asar)
- macOS security not the issue (tried right-click open, terminal execution)

## PROJECT GOALS:
- Create Windows .exe and Mac .app files
- Single download file friends can double-click to run
- No Node.js installation required for end users
- Include Chrome/browser engine for Puppeteer
- Keep existing server.js and UI completely unchanged
- File size under 500MB preferred

## WHAT I NEED:
- Working step-by-step solution for packaging
- Clear explanation of why previous approaches failed
- Alternative approaches if Electron won't work
- Ability to test/iterate in IDE rather than terminal commands

## CONSTRAINTS:
- I'm non-technical, need clear instructions
- Want to avoid more terminal command sequences
- Don't want to modify working server.js scraping logic
- Need solution that actually works for distribution

## CURRENT FILES TO WORK WITH:
- server.js (working scraper)
- public/index.html (working UI)
- package.json (has Electron deps but may need cleanup)
- main.js (various broken versions exist)

The core scraper functionality is solid and tested - I just need a reliable way to package it for desktop distribution.
