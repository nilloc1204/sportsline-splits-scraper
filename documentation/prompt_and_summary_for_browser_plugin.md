# Summary of Current Working Features and Plan for Browser Plugin

## Overview
This document summarizes the current working features of the MLB Season Splits Scraper and outlines a plan to explore alternative distribution methods, such as a browser extension.

## Current Working Features

- **Local Testing**: Fully functional when run locally with `node server.js`.

## Challenges Faced
- **Desktop App Packaging**: Encountered multiple issues with both macOS and Windows packaging.
- **Compatibility Issues**: "This app can't run on your PC" error on Windows 8.1.
- **Installation Errors**: Problems with uninstalling old files and running the installer.

## Successes
- **Local Functionality**: The scraper works flawlessly in a local environment.
- **Configuration Adjustments**: Made multiple configuration changes to address errors.

## Plan for Browser Plugin
1. **Explore Feasibility**: Determine if a browser extension can support the current scraping logic.
2. **Research Extension APIs**: Look into Chrome Extension APIs to see if they can replicate current functionality.
3. **Prototype Development**: Start with a basic extension to test core features.

## Conclusion
